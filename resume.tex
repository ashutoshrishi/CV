  \section{Coursework Projects}
  
  \textbf{Masters Research Project on Compiler Construction,} \hfill
  \textit{2015 to 2016}\\
  \textbf{University of Melbourne}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Worked on a compiler for a new multi-paradigm language, \textit{Wybe},
    with a new Logic \\ Programming based Intermediate Representation
    (\textit{LPVM}) and LLVM.
  \item Compiler written completely in Haskell.
  \item Researched and implemented various techniques to create an incremental
    and \\work-saving compilation process.
  \end{itemize}

  \textbf{Compiler for a Toy Language in OCaml} \hfill \textit{Semester 1,
    2016}\\
  \textbf{Programming Language Implementation, UniMelb}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Implemented a complete compiler for a toy language in OCaml as part of
    a semester\\ long project.
  \item Developed a basic \textit{diff} based testing framework for the
    compiler outputs in OCaml \\as extra work.
  \end{itemize}
  

  \textbf{Twitter Analysis REST Service over an Open Stack IAAS,} 
  \hfill \textit{Semester 1, 2015}\\
  \textbf{Cluster and Cloud Computing, UniMelb}
  \begin{itemize}
  \item Wrote a Python client to harvest geo-located tweets around SF into a
    CouchDB \\
    instance. The client ran as a daemon parallely from two different servers.
  \item Wrote a Python application to perform several different analyses on the
    stored data, \\
    making use of CouchDB Map-Reduce views and present it's result
    as a REST API.
  \item Setup a NGINX server on an instance to host the website presenting this
    data \\ through graphs and heat maps.
  \item We built our own orchestration tool using Bash scripts and rsync,
    imitating Ansible.
    
  \end{itemize}
