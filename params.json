","body":"I was not really interested in making a CV in word format. In fact, I\r\nfind it easier and faster to write and format a page in HTML than in a\r\nword-like processing software.\r\n\r\nSo, I wrote my CV in a markdown file: **cv.md**.\r\n\r\nWhy markdown and not Latex if I wanted a PDF at the end?\r\n--------------------------------------------------------\r\n\r\nSimple answer: I am more comfortable with markdown, html and css.\r\n\r\nMarkdown allows for inserting HTML+CSS in the document. So while most\r\ntext bodies are in markdown, HTML tags wrap around it. Plus, I used\r\nthe awesome **Bootstrap** project to style the CV. The result is a\r\nclean, but styled, CV which is made using tools I love to use.\r\n\r\nThe entire process used (in order):\r\n\r\n1. Markdown + Bootstrap\r\n2. Pandoc - To convert from markdown to .html\r\n3. WKHTMLTOPDF - To output a pdf from the html file\r\n\r\nLastly, because the CV is never stagnant and needs to improve as I\r\ngrow, I put it under version control. Let it increment as I understand\r\nand learn further.\r\n\r\n","google":"","name":"CV"}
